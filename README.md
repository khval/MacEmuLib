# MacEmuLib

This project contains a small .cpp file to emulate some of MacOS 7.x.x toolbox features, 
the project also contains ThinkC examples converted for use with GNUC, for testing of the library.

The aim of this project is make not too hard to port or convert MacOS7.x.x programs, so that they will run on AmigaOS4.x.

Anyway this project will fall under MIT License with exceptions.

The Intended use is for MacEmuLib is to be compiled into your projects, so you are allowed to use it commercially or none commercially. 

As for the Symantic examples you should not use this commercially. I can’t and do not grant you right to sell other people’s work.
(if turns out I was mistaken to includes this files, then I will remove this files from the project and reupload the project without.)

I’m assuming that Symantec examples where to allow beginner to get started, so I guess its ok copy to modify and share, but it does really say if can use this commercially or not. Think C is publicly available on maybe Macintosh repositories and manual, can also be found in PDF format, because Symantec has not asked these files to be removed, I assume its abandoned. The product is from 1991, and is not really relevant today. I doubt they care anymore. (just because it abandoned does not mean they are not the copyright holders, they can ask to have something removed.)
